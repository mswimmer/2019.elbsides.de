**Hamburg** deserves a community security event and [we](about.html) are finally able to deliver. This September 16th, 2019 at the Side Hotel Hamburg, the first Elbsides will take place. This one-day event will involve talks and workshops by top speakers for a nominal charge. In the spirit of all BSides events we are aiming to keep admission at the price of a good meal, well under our costs. For this reason, we are dependent on [sponsors](sponsors.html) to make this happen.
